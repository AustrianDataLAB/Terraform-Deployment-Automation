# Project Value Proposition

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic framework and value proposition for automating Terraform deployments. The project aims to streamline cloud infrastructure management processes for organizations, significantly reducing manual overhead and promoting efficiency.

### Core Value

- **Facilitate Terraform deployment automation.**

## Team

- **Project Owner / Deputy Owner:**
  - PO: Andrej Cermak
  - DO: [Deputy owner name here]

- **Team Members:**
  - Andrej Cermak, Petar Soric, Carl Lavo, Ondrej Ulehla

### Status

- ACTIVE / INACTIVE / SHIPPED / [status to be filled]

## Problem Space

### Why are we doing this?

- **Problem Statement:** There are OS organizations trying to automate their VM deployment via Terraform, to remove this hurdle from non-IT users.

### Overview:

- **API:** Functionality that lets users create/delete/modify their cloud infrastructure via API calls, enabling Terraform automation.
- **Docker Deployment:** This project should be packed into a Docker image and be easily deployable.

### Impact of This Problem

The use of our software would be a stepping stone to the Open OnDemand extension, which should let users run predefined applications on their OpenStack instances via the OOD interface, removing unnecessary technical aspects for the user. It can then be used by any organization offering both OpenStack and Open OnDemand solutions.

### Who is the Customer / Target Audience

- Universities/organizations offering cloud solutions.

### How Do We Judge Success?

- **Goals and Success Criteria:** What are the goals of the project and the success criteria by which they will be measured? These need to be specific and measurable.

### Time from Input to Deployment

## Minimal Viable Product/Service ("MVP")

### What needs to be true for a prototype to be ready for release?

- **Release Conditions:** We can release our MVP to the target audience as soon as we have:
  1. **Must-Have Features:** Deployment of Terraform.
      - Note that the document's service, the planning software, and the workflow engine are not must-have features.
  2. **Must-Have Non-Functionals:** [list non-functionals here]

This will be sufficient for the target audience to touch and feel the most essential parts and give us feedback. An MVP is a contract with your "client" and should be concrete and objectively measurable, independent of the solution.

### What crucial factors are we missing?

- **Dependencies and Blocks:** What keeps us from working? Exact requirements not clear. What dependencies are outside our control and are blocking us?
- **Assumptions:** What assumptions are we making that need to be validated or refuted? Is our application usable in the real world?

### Prioritize Features

- **Questions for Confidence:** What questions will increase our confidence in the decisions we need to make? What are the gaps in our understanding? What does their current system look like? How does it work internally?
- **Customer Interaction:** What happens if customers don’t want to use our application and e.g., order by phone/email?

## Continued Feedback

### Key Questions for Validation

- **Alpha Testers:** Who are the alpha testers that we can use for validating our assumptions?
- Formulate at least one question that quantitatively helps you gauge if the solution would be accepted.
- Formulate at least one question that qualitatively helps you gauge if the solution would be accepted.
